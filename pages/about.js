          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>The 3DWorkSpace project aims to deliver a platform for reuse of 3D models and collaboration, by adapting the open-source Voyager 3D digital museum curation tool suite. This way, interactive engagement with traditionally complex digital datasets can be promoted. Embedded structured guidance, or Learning Pathways, will be generated to provide training for gaining competence and skills for interpreting 3D datasets. Through the creation of annotated personal 3D collections that can be tailored to specific learning goals or interests, broader narratives can be generated and new avenues for knowledge publication opened up.
